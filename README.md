- Hi! üëã I'm Matt Carrier.
- I'm currently learning [nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) while sometimes messing around with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
- During my day job I work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on infrastructure and deployment tooling.
- My latest hobby is building custom [keyboards](https://bastardkb.com/) ‚å®Ô∏è and [firmware](https://github.com/icecreammatt/qmk_firmware/) with alternative [layouts](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/).
